introduction: |

  I'm a __Preliminary Security Operational Analyst__ at [__Monzo__](https://monzo.com). I work on my personal projects whenever I get a bit of free time (_such as my homelab - blog posts incoming at some point maybe_) 🖥️
  
  This started with my 3 years at Kingston University London, where I completed and received an upper second class degree with honours in Cyber Security and Computer Forensics 🤓🎓

  If you’d ever like to get in touch with me for whatever reason, I have a [**standing invitation**](/contact/standing-invitation) open, so please do email me at [__hello@aaroncarson.co.uk__](mailto:hello@aaroncarson.co.uk) ✉️

  _I also have a [__GPG key__](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/93BADDC3FE56CDAB908E9096303C76F0807676E2) which you can use if you want to keep it secret_ 🤫
